# Scott Hayashida's Portfolio

My name is Scott Hayashida and I am a computer science major at CSUF. I plan  on graduating in 2028.

### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2 Part 1
This was a really fun lab for me. In the lab we recreated the famous word game “mad libs.” Even though the programming skills required to complete the lab were not much, it got an easy point across. This lab helped me understand how the I/O functions interacted with the Linux Terminal.

Lab 6
Lab 6 helped me better understand the command line interface. I figured out that I was able to use information from the command line as part of my code. Additionally, part 2 taught how we could develop our very own blackjack game, which was super exciting.

Lab 12
I have to put Lab 12 as my personal favorite. It summed up everything that we had learned in the class very well. Being able to create a visual image as a product of our code was also very cool. This lab has inspired me to discover more about computer graphics.
